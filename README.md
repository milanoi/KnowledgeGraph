# KnowledgeGraph

A wakthrough of how to implement a knowledge graph.
In-depth breakdown of processes and methods used are in markdown in the Jupyter notebooks.
Read in this order:
1. EDA and LDA
2. Entity Extraction
3. Knowledge Graph Pre-Processing
4. Knowledge Graph (Coming Soon)

Once I'm done with part four i'll link the Google Colab notebooks as well.

Suggestions, questions and comments are welcome :)
